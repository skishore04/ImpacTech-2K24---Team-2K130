# TRAVEL AND TOURISM Android Application

Our tourism app is designed to enhance your travel experience by providing a comprehensive plan of action for your duration in a destination. Through a series of carefully curated tasks, you'll explore all the must-visit places and hidden gems, ensuring you make the most of your time.

## Technology Stack:
- **Android Studio**
- **Firebase**

### Workflow of the Application:

1. **Login/Sign Up Page:**
   - If the user is new, they sign up with their credentials.
   - If the user is already registered, they log in with their username/email and password.

2. **Category Selection:**
   - After login/signup, the user is prompted to select a category for their trip (e.g., family, friends, solo, adventure, etc.).

3. **Location and Trip Duration Selection:**
   - The user selects the location they plan to visit from a list of available options.
   - They specify the duration of their trip (e.g., number of days/nights).

4. **Visitor's Interest Input:**
   - The user is asked to input their interests/preferences (e.g., historical sites, adventure activities, culinary experiences, etc.).
   - These interests are mandatory as they will help tailor the trip itinerary to the user's preferences.

5. **Task Assignment:**
   - Based on the selected location, duration, and user interests, the app generates a personalized itinerary.
   - Tasks are assigned for each day of the trip, including places to visit, restaurants to try, activities to participate in, etc.
   - Each task is associated with a specific day of the trip (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, etc.).

6. **Task Completion and Coin Claiming:**
   - As the user completes each task, they mark it as completed within the app.
   - Successfully completing tasks earns the user coins.
   - The app verifies task completion through user input or location check-ins.

7. **Coupon Redemption:**
   - At the end of the trip, the user can claim a coupon for their last day of the trip for free.
   - The coupon is redeemable based on specific criteria, such as completing a certain percentage of tasks or achieving a minimum number of coins.

8. **Trip Completion:**
   - After the trip, the user can review their experience and provide feedback on the tasks and overall itinerary.
   - They may also have the option to share their experience on social media platforms.

This structured flow ensures a seamless user experience from login to trip completion, with personalized recommendations and incentives for task completion.
